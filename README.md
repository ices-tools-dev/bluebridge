# bluebridge
Assorted tasks tangentially or otherwise associated with ICES and BlueBRIDGE

Each task should be in a sub-folder. Once complete, we can split off [subfolders](https://help.github.com/articles/splitting-a-subfolder-out-into-a-new-repository/)  into new ices-tools-dev or ices-tools-prod repositories.
